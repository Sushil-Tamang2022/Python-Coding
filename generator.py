# Generator = Function that behaves like an iterator (it can be used in a for loop)
#                      Pauses a function, returns a value, then resumes
#                      Uses 'yield' instead or 'return'
#                      Iterate without loading everything into memory (ex. reading large files)
#                      return = Pouring bucket
#                      yield = Drip faucet
